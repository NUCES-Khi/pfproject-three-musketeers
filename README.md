## Proposal
Project Proposal: Four in a Row Game in C using 2D between two players 
## Overview:
The project aims to create a two-player "Four in a Row" game in the C programming language using arrays, it will be similar to the console games of the DOS era.
Project Description:
•	The "Four in a Row" game is a classic board game where two players take turns dropping colored discs into a grid to connect four of their discs in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
•	The game will be implemented in C, providing hands-on experience in functions, user input, logic, and loops.
Methodology and Approach:
•	The input will be taken in the 2D in form of alpha-numeric code making the game user friendly.
•	Loops will be used to validate inputs and check if a player has won.
•	Using functions input translation and win conditions will be checked; filing will be used to store data of wins.
•	C's standard libraries will be used for input/output along with heap memory allocation for dynamic storage.

We kindly request your feedback and approval of this project proposal. Your guidance will be invaluable as we work on creating the "Four in a Row" game in C.

## Future Work to do
Update filing and make ouput more better looking
Check and test the win coditions
